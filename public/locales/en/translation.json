      "MTB": "Simulator of Bubnovsky (MTB)",
      "MTBDescription": "Disorders of the musculoskeletal system, heart, and blood vessels are common problems today. Properly selected physical loads can help get rid of them. For this purpose, the Bubnovsky simulator was developed. MTB or Bubnovsky simulator stimulates the work of deep back muscles and improves and restores joint mobility. The anti-gravity and decompression system reduces pain syndrome and relieves muscle spasms. The anti-gravity system means that your body (or parts of the body) is suspended when all your muscles and joints are completely unloaded, the force of gravity does not act on them, and complete stretching and relaxation occur. It is exercises of this type that relieve pain syndromes. The decompression system involves reducing the contact of joint surfaces by stretching, thus reducing the risk of wear and tear of inter-joint cartilage, as muscles work exclusively.",
      "Rule": "«Pravilo» simulator",

In the past, it was widely used for various purposes: it was part of military training for soldiers, and regular people used it to improve their health. Nowadays, «Pravilo» is becoming increasingly popular as a strength training device that engages many muscles and improves the body's functioning. Training on the simulator activates the body's self-regulation processes and promotes positive changes in the musculoskeletal system, which is directly responsible for muscular activity. During training, physiological processes associated with abundant secretion of synovial (inter-articular) fluid, which nourishes cartilage tissue, participates in metabolic exchange in the joints, removes dead cells from them through lymphatic vessels, performs a barrier-protective immune function and is a natural lubricant in the joints, occur due to the release of the joint, slight flexion during tension, and in combination with proper breathing. Muscle tone improves. Training on the «Pravilo» is very useful for people with spine problems, as well as for their prevention. During spine extension, intervertebral gaps increase, which reduces nerve compression, reduces internal disc pressure, restores blood circulation, relieves pain, and most importantly, stretching prevents the formation of stagnation in the spine, which is an excellent prevention of scoliosis, osteochondrosis, radiculitis, etc.",
